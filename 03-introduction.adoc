== Introduction

This model considers addresses - 'street addresses' - to be a form of compound name for a geospatial feature. For example, the Australian address:

----
72 Yundah Street
Shorncliffe QLD
4017 Australia
----

is a form of name for the cadastral parcel that defines a particular property's extend - a 'lot'.

Addresses modelled according to this model do more than just name things though: they are linked to geocodes - spatial points - allowing for map-based locating and route planning, sometimes other addresses for the same spatial object, sometimes parent/child addresses for dwelling compounds and management information such as lifecycle stages.

Overall, this model represents addresses, certain properties for them, including address parts, geocodes and the objects to which addresses are assigned in a conceptual manner similar to the international addressing standard, <<ISO19160-1>>. However, this model is expressed in Semantic Webfootnote:[See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web for a general description of the Semantic Web] form, rather than ISO19160-1's UML and XML, and many aspects of the conceptual range that ISO19160 covers this model does not directly cover but instead delegates to other models which it imports, such as the representation of address and address part lifecycle information. This is done so that common things that this model does are available for use elsewhere via a series of mini-models that others may use without importing this whole model.

Additionally, this model relies on several specialised sub-models to handle specific types of address parts, such as streets and geographical object naming. By doing this, those things many be modelled independently of addressing and streets and geographic object names datasets can be used with address data very easily.

This model makes no attempt to model the things to which addresses are assigned. In the example above, the address "72 Yundah St...." is mentioned as being a form of name for, or assigned to, a cadastral parcel or a 'lot'. This model doesn't know what those things are and leaves their modelling to other systems. This means that using this model alone, you cannot know what an address is for unless you implement an address part to describe the type of object the address is assigned to. This decision has been made since there could be great complexity in spatial object / infrastructure modelling that isn't really core to addressing, so that's best left to other, likely sophisticated, models.


=== Sources of Requirements

In 2021, the Australia and New Zealand https://www.icsm.gov.au/[Intergovernmental Committee on Surveying and Mapping] established an https://www.icsm.gov.au/publications/addressing-2035[Addressing 2035 Strategy] that aimed to "provide leadership, coordination and standards for assembling, delivering and maintaining address datasets". The Strategy listed "Strategic Pillars", such as "Jurisdictional flexibility" - things for Strategy implementers to aim for - "Guiding Principles", "Overarching Pain Points" and other system/model/situation requirements. While the Strategy did not present an address model, it had an addendum that listed 10 requirements for a future address data model: https://www.icsm.gov.au/publications/addressing-strategy-information-addendum[Addendum to the Strategy]. These 10 requirements are a major source of this Address Models requirements.

These ICSM requirements include both specific requirements, for example to cater for "Multi-lingual and alternate name addressing", and also requirements to align with other address-related initiative which might be a source of multiple individual requirements, for example "Model interoperability" which, in its detailed description, indicates a requirement for an address model to align with a baseline set of spatial data standards that ICSM might create.

<<AnnexA>> lists the ICSM Addressing 2035 Strategy Addendum's 10 requirements and indicates how this model implements solutions for them.


=== Major Modelling Principles

Major modelling principles present in this model are:

. <<Model Reuse>>
. <<External Vocabularies>>
. <<Feature / Feature Naming differentiation>>
. <<Feature / Geometry differentiation>>
. <<Geocodes>>
. <<Address Parts>>
. <<Street & Geographical Names>>
. <<Address part typing>>
. <<Address part templating>>
. <<Water-based Addressing>>
. <<Related Addresses>>
. <<Status Authority & Lifecycles>>

These principles are explained in the following subsections and the first two reference the following figure.


==== Model Reuse

The Semantic Web contains many widely-used models and model reuse is a greatly favoured practice for Semantic Web modelling for, if models are reused, data created according to them is instantly compatible with other data. Additionally, many Semantic Web models have deep thought behind them that no single modelling initiative could hope to match easily.

The well-known Semantic Web models that this model inherits from are:

* Web Ontology Language <<OWL>>: a widely-used set theory-based general-purpose model that uses the <<RDF>> data structure
* schema.org <<SDO>>: a general-purpose model of classes and properties used by many website publishers to present structured data to search engines
* GeoSPARQL <<GEO>>: the Open Geospatial Consortium'sfootnote:[The OGC: https://www.ogc.org/] ontology for basic features and geometries modelling
* Simple Knowledge Organization System <<SKOS>>: a simple OWL model for organizing taxonomies of concepts

Some aspects of addressing that were originally modelled within this model at its first release in 2021 have been discovered to be generic in nature but yet not already modelled in a Semantic Web ontology appropriate for use here. For those aspects of addressing, a series of mini-models have been created to allow the generic parts to be published independently of addressing, allowing for independent and hopefully greater reuse. The main mini-models factored out of this model are:

* Compound Naming Model <<CNM>>: modelling of names objects, parts of names, and the things names are assigned to
* Lifecycles Model <<LM>>: modelling of lifecycles for anything - whole addresses, parts of addresses etc.


==== External Vocabularies

Some elements of addresses must be subclassified by, or in some other way associated with, terms from vocabularies. The most prominent example is the expression of the type of part of an address: is it a _street number_, a _flat type_ or a _postcode_?

Where such vocabularies are used, they are not directly published _within_ this model but externally and this model is expected to be used with them. In this way, vocabularies may be extended without extending this model and different users may implement their own vocabularies to suite their business needs, for example, perhaps not all model users allow all address part types Queensland does, such as _water feature number_ so, they should use this model with a vocabulary that excludes that term.

See the <<Supporting Vocabularies>> section for mode information.


==== Feature / Feature Naming differentiation

This model details the elements of an _address_ but not details of the spatial objects that addresses are assigned to. The general conceptual split of address/spatial object follows the Address/AddressableObject split in ISO19160-1 <<ISO19160-1>>. Addresses are seen as a form of complex, multi-part, name for a spatial Feature.

This allows for the representation, and ultimately the management, of names - text, numbers, identifiers, references - separately to the management of spatial objects.

This Feature / Feature Naming separation applies to Geographical objects, Streets and Administrative Areas as well as Addresses and the first two of those three objects have models similar to this one for their names, <<GN>> & <<ROADS>>.

Some elements of this Feature / Feature Naming pattern, used by this and the two models mentioned above, are captured in the general-purpose _Compound Naming Model_ <<CNM>> which they all inherit from.


==== Feature / Geometry differentiation

(Geo)spatial objects referenced by this model are not geometries but conceptual spatial objects that may have as an expression of their spatial projection one or more geometries. This conceptual object / spatial expression differentiation, which we refer to as a Feature / Geometry split, is based on fundamental spatial modelling in standards such as <<ISO19101-1>> and their expression in the Semantic Web spatial standard <<GEO>>.

This Feature / Geometry split allows individual spatial objects to have multiple Geometries: different resolutions, in different coordinate systems and even sets of Geometries that have different roles or that show variation over time.

While this model doesn't model spatial aspects of the object to which addresses are assigned - see the section above - this Feature / Geometry split and expressions of geometry are modelled for geocodes - see next section.


==== Geocodes

Geocodes are spatial objects - Features - with point geometries that addresses may be associated with so that they can be used by mapping applications to locate the address, or part of an addressable object, on a map or on the earth.

Geocodes may be only indirectly related to an Addressable Object: while they may be calculated from them, for example they could be the centroid of a lot, they may also not be, for example they could be a GPS-marked point indicating a property entrance point that is on or close to the Addressable Object but has been determined independently of its details.

For this reason, Geocodes are related to Addresses only in this model, not Addressable Objects, and any Geocode/Addressable Object relations are out-of-scope here.


==== Address Parts

Addresses are complex things: they are all made of multiple parts with different roles, types ordering and so on. To handle this, this model has a generic notion of a part which may be a simple thing, e.g. a postcode or a street number, but it may also be a complex thing, e.g. a street name that includes a "given" name for the street as well as some type indication.

This model inherits from the Compound Naming Model <<CNM>> which allows for Compound Names, such as Addresses, to link to parts which are also Compound Names which then link to other Compound Names. In this way, Addresses may be "built up" from compound names for a series of parts, such as street names, locality names and so on.


==== Street & Geographical Names

This model can be used to model all the parts of a street names - the 'given' part e.g. "Smith", a type indicator such as "Street" and perhaps a suffix, such as "South" - or it can be used to just indicate that a particular street is a part of an address and the name for that street is to be found in an independent object.

This second form - delegation of name - is allowed to facilitate point-of-truth datasets which both provide names for streets in isolation and are also used by address datasets.

Similarly, names for geographical objects, such as mountains, lakes, certain kinds of locality etc. may also be held independently of addressing data and just referred to as a complex object part of an address.

A model of streets - both naming and some physical presentation of them - has been created in parallel to this model, as has a model of Geographical Names which is a replacement for the various Placenames models found in ANZ, such as the https://linked.data.gov.au/def/placenames[FSDF Placenames Ontology]. These models can be used independently as well as within this model. Their persistent web addresses are:

* https://linked.data.gov.au/def/roads - Streets, called the Roads Model
* https://linked.data.gov.au/def/gn - Geographical Names Model


==== Address part typing

There are various given name parts of addresses which have previously been shoved into inappropriate data fields legacy address models and systems. For example, some models have contained _building_ but not _property_ names, so both types have been combined into the field for the former.

In this model, all address parts are just parts with a specialised type indicated with a reference to a concept within a vocabulary such as the Address Parts vocabulary (see <<Supporting Vocabularies>>). Implementations _MUST_ allow for this type of "soft typing" (where a data object's type is selectable from an external list) so that no field limitations such as the above occur.

Implementers can limit the part type vocabulary of course and will have to handel all the types they allow in the vocabulary, but implementers should not "make do" with inappropriate field (part type) reuse.


==== Address part templating

This model is a conceptual model of addressing information and implementations of it will need to make or use logical and physical models. 'conceptual', 'logical', and 'physical' are variants of data models that show different levels of detail/abstraction for different purposesfootnote:[See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_modeling#Conceptual.2C_logical_and_physical_schemas[this Wikipedia Data Modeling article] for a good starting point to more information].

None of the model types listed above provide logic for things like data presentation, so they will not be able to show you how to "print out" an address. So if I have an address' information represented according to this model and implemented in a graph, relational or other database system, I will still need _business logic_ implemented in _application code_ to realise the "print out".

This model expects implementers to use some form of templating to create address "print outs" and other forms of presentation.

While not a core part of this model, templating suggestions are presented in <<AnnexC>>.


==== Water-based Addressing

The ability to cater for addresses reachable by watercraft was a requirement of Queensland's project that generated this model. Water-based addressing is standardised in the Australian/New Zealand standard <<AS4189:2011>> and it requires that water-based addressing use the name of the water feature as well as a water address number, the logic for the assignment of which is feature-specific, i.e. numbers for islands and for watercourses are determined differently.

This model indicates the use of a typed reference from an Address to a Water Feature object, just as Addresses reference Street or Locality objects, and then the Water Feature itself supplies the format of its name, including typing, e.g. Lord Howe _Island_ or Slacks _Creek_ any abbreviations or other name variants, e.g. _Wop pa_ as an indigenous name variant of Great Keppel Island.

This model does not supply the logic for water number generation, just as it does not supply the logic for street number assignment, however it does provide address part types for water-based addressing, see the <<Address Part Types>> in the <<Supporting Vocabularies>> section.

This model does not provide templating or application logic to show how a water-based address should order water address parts or perhaps use water addressing parts and not street addressing parts: templating logic is exemplified in the templating annex <<AnnexC>> and appropriate part usage logic is left to implementers.


==== Related Addresses

Many previous address models contain provisions for the modelling of related addresses. These may take the form of multiple addresses that are aliases for a single Addressable Object or perhaps "parent" and "child" addresses for a property with multiple sub-addresses and an overarching address, such as a unit complex.

This model does not implement any such logic for several reasons:

. Representing relations characterised outside of addressing data within addressing data fails to use point-of-truth information
.. As per the introductory sentence above, logic for "parent" and "child" addressing or aliases is held in topological relationships or object identity, not addressing data
. Addressing information is almost always managed alongside information about the objects addressed
.. This follows from the previous point: if object relations that an be used to infer address relations are available to address database implementers, they should be used directly, not re-implemented
. Previous Address models provide other properties for addresses that impact on address relations
.. for example, two related addresses might only be fully understood when the authority of the addresses is also known
.. this means properties are not independent and this is a data modelling anti-pattern as it introduced maintenance issues

Expected use of this model to cater for related addresses requires the combined use of this model with any other models, as per the section <<Model Reuse>> above, that contain the logic for relating addresses. Two examples of how related addresses _could_ be represented by this model and the use of general topological rules, such as those provided by GeoSPARQL <<GEO>> are given next.

===== Emulating address aliases

Other address models state something such as:

----
AddressX isAliasOf AddressY
----

Or, the inverse:

----
AddrezzY hasAlias AddressX
----

This indicates that `AddressX` and `AddressY` are for the same Addressable Object. Other models may also indicate that, of the two addresses, one is preferred or in some way more authoritative, perhaps like this:

----
AddressX isPrimary True
AddressY isPrimary False
----

Taken together we have:

----
AddressX
    hasAlias AddressY
    isPrimary True

AddressXY
    hasAlias AddressX
    isPrimary False
----

If aliasing logic is that Addresses are aliases when they are both assigned to the same Addressable Object, then we can determine whether Addresses have aliases by just inspecting the identify of the thing they are addresses for. This would be implemented like this:

----
AddressX
    isAddressFor ObjectM

AddressY
    isAddressFor ObjectM
----

Since most address models require the identity of the thing an address is for - perhaps an Addressable Object, an address "Site" or similar, then this requires no additional information to see that an alias exists.

To cater for primary/secondary-style modelling, we look to the status of the addresses independently of their aliasing:

----
AddressX
    hasStatus Official

AddressY
    hasStatus Unofficial
----

As for addressable object identification, most address models have a mechanism for indicating status/officialness. This model does it by relating an Address to a Lifecycle Stage with a type, such as Official, and, if that Lifecycle Stage is current, then the address has that status. Informal modelling according to this model to emulate `AddressX` being a 'primary' and `AddressY` being a 'secondary' for the same object, with `AddressY` previously having been the 'primary' could be:

----
AddressX
    isAddressFor ObjectM
    hasLifecycleStage
        type Official
        status Current
    hasLifecycleStage
        type Unofficial
        status Expired

AddressY
    isAddressFor ObjectM
    hasLifecycleStage
        type Unofficial
        status Current
    hasLifecycleStage
        type Official
        status Expired
----

===== Emulating parent/child address relations

The most common logic for parent/child (or primary/secondary, whole/part or some other pair of mereologicalfootnote:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mereology] terms) relations is that a parent address is for a large property such as a unit complex and that the child addresses are for the parts within the parent, such as units in the complex.

Such logic, at least for unit complexes is necessarily spatial: all the child units are spatially within the parent.

Since this model already relies on spatial representation and topological relations inherited from the GeoSPARQL <<GEO>> model, the emulation of parent/child addressing just uses GeosPARQL relationships for the Addressable Objects like this:

If `AddressP` is the parent of `AddressK`, `AddressL` & `AddredssM`, then we would expect to see modelling like this:

----
AddressP
    isAddressFor ObjectP

AddressK
    isAddressFor ObjectK

AddressL
    isAddressFor ObjectL

AddressM
    isAddressFor ObjectM

ObjectK isWithin ObjectP
ObjectL isWithin ObjectP
ObjectM isWithin ObjectP
----

Other standard topological relations could be used so that the inverse to _within_, _contains_, could be stated:

----
AddressP
    isAddressFor ObjectP

AddressK
    isAddressFor ObjectK

AddressL
    isAddressFor ObjectL

AddressM
    isAddressFor ObjectM

ObjectP
    contains
        ObjectK
        ObjectL
        ObjectM
----

Not that it's common in existing address models, but sibling addresses could be emulated in this way by using a _touches_ relation between Addressable Objects.


==== Status Authority & Lifecycles

Other address models provide for notions of authority - whether addresses are ratified by some authoritative body or not - separately to notions of lifecycle - where, in stages of development an address is. This model does not and instead indicates status and authority all-in-one with relations from an Address to one or more Lifecycle Stages which can indicate both a particular Stage or status and a temporal range, as per the Lifecycle Model <<LM>>.

An informal address may be indicated like this:

----
AddressX
    hasLifecycleStage
        status Informal
----

If an address is proposed in the 1st of January, 2023, and it is not yet accepted/ratified, thus it is still informal, it could be modelled like this:

----
AddressX
    hasLifecycleStage
        startDate 2023-01-01
        status Proposed
----

If that address became formal, status 'Ratified', on the 1st of June, 2023, then you might have:

----
AddressX
    hasLifecycleStage
        startDate 2023-06-01
        status Ratified
    hasLifecycleStage
        startDate 2023-01-01
        endDate 2023-06-01
        status Proposed
----

See the <<AnnexD>> for formal examples of this modelling.

Implementers are free to create their own Lifecycle Stage types - statuses - using vocabularies.
