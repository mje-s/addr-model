== Annex A: Requirements

The 10 major requirements for Australian and New Zealand address models, as per the https://www.icsm.gov.au/[Intergovernmental Committee on Surveying and Mapping] established an https://www.icsm.gov.au/publications/addressing-2035[Addressing 2035 Strategy]'s https://www.icsm.gov.au/publications/addressing-strategy-information-addendum[Addendum] are:

. <<req-1, Better complex / multi address representation>>
. <<req-2, Shared addressable object / address conception>>
. <<req-3, Model interoperability>>
. <<req-4, Model profiling and mapping>>
. <<req-5, International model uptake>>
. <<req-6, New address dimensions>>
. <<req-7, Enhanced address life-cycle management>>
. <<req-8, Address validation at creation point>>
. <<req-9, Verifiable model conformance>>
. <<req-10, Multi-lingual and alternate name addressing>>

Next follows a description per Requirement as to how this Model addresses it.

[[req-1]]
=== A.1 Better complex / multi address representation

The Model allows for any number of levels of sub-addressing and anchors the Addressable Objects to items in other systems (e.g. Cadastral databases) so any form of complex address scenario can be represented via a combination of Address and/or Addressable Object relations

[[req-2]]
=== A.2 Shared addressable object / address conception

This Model inherits the Address / Addressable Object pattern from the Compound Naming Model <<CNM>> which it profiles.

[[req-3]]
=== A.3 Model interoperability

The Model is implemented in the general-purpose Web Ontology Language and is thus compatible with all RDF & SPARQL systems.

The Model profiles a number of common, general-purpose, Semantic Web models, such as GeoSPARQL (spatiality), OWL-TIME (temporality), PROV (provenance / process flow), schema.org (general-purpose description) and thus is compatible with other models that profile these too.

Some of this Model’s key patterns are inherited from the stand-alone Compound Naming <<CNM>> and Lifecycle <<LM>> models which other models may also inherit from leading to interoperability on those patterns.

[[req-4]]
=== A.4 Model profiling and mapping

The profiling mechanism this Model uses to inherit from well-known international standard models and also special-purpose models may be reused for other models to profile this Model.

The Model is published as a Profiles Vocabulary profile with profile elements that assist with the development of profiles of this Model, for example, separately-published codelists as vocabularies which may be extended or constrained.

Due to this model inheriting from standard models, it may adopt mapping from them to others, for example, GeoSPARQL’s mapping to the ISO Simple Features model <<ISO19125-1>>.

[[req-5]]
=== A.5 International model uptake

This Model profiles multiple international models – both general-purpose and domain-specific – in particular it profiles _ISO 19160-1: Addressing_ <<ISO19160-1>>.

[[req-6]]
=== A.6 New address dimensions

This Model uses the modelling https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-world_assumption[_Open World Assumption_] within the context of the Semantic Web, meaning that the model may be extended in any direction, as long as the extension doesn’t invalidate existing model rules.

[[req-7]]
=== A.7 Enhanced address life-cycle management

This Model inherits from the Lifecycles Model <<LM>> and allows lifecycles to be applied to any model class such as Address, Addressable Object, Address Component.

The stages of the Lifecycle Model are defined by vocabularies thus any implementer may extend or constrain available stages to suite their purpose.

[[req-8]]
=== A.8 Address validation at creation point

One resource within the set that make up this model is a canonical validator that can be used to ’validate any data claiming conformance to this Model. Additionally, further validators may be created for this model that either implementing special-purpose validators may be created, for example, for validation of partial addresses.

[[req-9]]
=== A.9 Verifiable model conformance

As per A.8, an implementor may choose to implement multiple versions of conformance by implementing multiple validators.

[[req-10]]
=== A.10 Multi-lingual and alternate name addressing

The Model allows for both the implementation of literal and complex objects’ annotations (names and descriptions) in language-specific model elements which may then be selected as appropriate.

Additionally, addresses are exported from this model using templates that may both select specific language versions of address elements and implement further logic such as word contractions, as needed.
