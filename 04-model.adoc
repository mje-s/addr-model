== Model

This model is composed of Web Ontology Language (OWL) <<OWL>> Classes and Properties. While some of the properties are restricted in their use to various classes, the Classes and Properties are actually defined individually and both are "first class model citizens", with global identity, that can be used in isolation and together. This is in contrast to Unified Modelling Language (UML) _Class Diagrams_ which treat most Properties as element of particular Classes.

This model defines only three Classes and no Properties but reuses many Classes and Properties from other models. For all Classes and Properties, given are: basic details; a reference to that Class or Properties' definition via `rdfs:isDefinedBy`; and a scope note about using it in this model.

Example data is given within the definition of the three Classes this model defines and all Properties used are present within them.

[[AddressableObject]]
==== Addressable Object

[cols="2,6"]
|===
| Property | Value

| IRI | `addr:AddressableObject`
| Preferred Label | Addressable Object
| Definition | An object that is unambiguously identified by an address.

Examples of types of AddressableObjects are a building, a dwelling or a land parcel
| Is Defined By | This model
| Subclass Of | <<Feature>>
| Provenance | Derived from <<ISO19160-1>>'s `AddressableObject` class and its associated codelist of subtypes
| Scope note | Judgement as to what makes for a permissible AddressableObject rests with the implementer. This model's technical requirements are only that the object is a legal `geo:Feature` object, thus implementers may make Addressable Objects of almost anything.

[[Geocode]]
==== Geocode

[cols="2,6"]
|===
| Property | Value

| IRI | `addr:Geocode`
| Preferred Label | Geocode
| Definition | A Geometry that has a persistent Role
| Is Defined By | This model
| Subclass Of | <<Geometry>>
| Provenance | Derived from the G-NAF's expression of Address position
| Scope note | Indicating a Geocode for an Address is a direct method of positioning the Address on the earth. Addresses may also be located by reference to an Addressable Object which is an indirect method. This model does not indicate any Geocode / Addressable Object geometry relations, although they may exist
| Expected Properties | <<additionalType>> - use to indicate the specialised type of a Geocode, <<hasSerialization, hasSerialization>> - use to indicate the position information of the Geocode

`geo:hasGeometry` - to indicate the position of the Geocode. A GeoSPARQL `Geometry`.
| Example
a| [source,turtle]
----
# An Address with a Geocode and a role
ex:addr-1
  a addr:Address ;
  addr:hasGeocode [
    schema:additionalType addr:buildingAccessPoint ;
    geo:asWKT "POINT (152.01 -35.03)"^^geo:wktLiteral ;  # specialised form of hasSerialization
