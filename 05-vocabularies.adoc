== Vocabularies

This model requires the use of vocabularies to provide values for some predicates. Values from a Geocode role type vocabulary must be used to provide value for a Geocode's <<additionalType>> predicate indicating the role that a Geocode plays, and similarly, values from a lifecycle stages vocabulary must be used to provide values for a Lifecycle Stage's <<additionalType>> predicate, indicating specialised lifecycle stage type. <<additionalType>> is frequently use to provide specialised typing for instances of classes.

[NOTE]
See the example for <<Address>> where vocabulary concepts are used for both Geocode's and Lifecycle Stage's <<additionalType>> predicates.

Wherever in the model the range value for a predicate is given as a `skos:Concept`, this indicates that a vocabulary must be used as opposed to literal (text, numerical) values. `skos:Concept` objects are presented within `skos:ConceptScheme` resources, which are controlled vocabularies.

Particular vocabularies _MUST_ be used within certain contexts of use of this model. The following subsections per known use context indicate which particular vocabularies must be used, where.

=== ICSM Australia & New Zealand Address Data Exchange

When address information formulated according to this model is exchanged within Australia & New Zealand according to the https://www.icsm.gov.au[Intergovernmental Committee on Surveying & Mapping]'s rules, the following predicates _MUST_ have range values selected from the indicated vocabularies.

=== Vocabularies previewed here

Those defined here are:

* <<Address Part Types>>
* <<Address Lifecycle Stage Types>>
* <<Geocode Type>>

NOTE: Hyperlinks to these vocabularies will be provided as soon as persistent identifiers for them are issued. Until then, the content of these vocabularies can be found within the submission to register them: https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/icsm-vocabs/pull/13/files.

==== Address Part Types

This vocabulary is an extended version of <<ISO19160-1>>'s _Address Component Type_ vocabulary and is maintained outside this model. This means it can be extended by the user community (Australian & New Zealand), as needed, and without change to this model.

The vocabulary is located online at:

* *https://linked.data.gov.au/def/addr-part-types*

The original 8 concepts from <<ISO19160-1, ISO19160-1>> are:

|===
| IRI | Preferred Label | Definition | Deprecation note

| `aptiso:addressedObjectIdentifier` | addressed object identifier | Identifier of the addressed object, e.g. building name or address number | Handled by `Address`/`AddressableObject` relation
| `aptiso:administrativeAreaName` | administrative area name | Name of an administrative area | Use `apt:stateOrTerritory`
| `aptiso:countryCode` | country code | ISO 3166-1 code for the country, territory, or area of geopolitical interest | Use `apt:country` to refer to a Country object
| `aptiso:countryName` | country name | Name of a country | Handled by use of `apt:country`
| `aptiso:localityName` | locality name | Name of a locality | Use `apt:locality` to refer to a Locality object
| `aptiso:postOfficeName` | post office name | Name of a post office | Not in current Australian address use
| `aptiso:postcode` | postcode | Code used for the sorting of mail | Use `apt:postcode`
| `aptiso:thoroughfareName` | thoroughfare name | Name of a thoroughfare | Use `apt:street` to refer to a street object
|===

These concepts have all been modified or completely replaced, except `postcode`. Replacements preference links to other complex objects, rather than simple literal data types, for example ISO19160-1's `countryCode` which indicates a text code value for a country has been replaced with `apt:country` which indicates a country object. The use of object references rather than literal values allows for element labelling variation, such as use of abbreviated forms of a name, e.g. "USA" instead of "United Stated of America" , or different language variants, e.g. "Deutschland" instead of "Germany", where the variant information is stored as part of the object referred to.

This vocab currently (June 2024) contains terms such as the following (not the complete vocabulary):

|===
| IRI | Preferred Label | Definition | Scope Note

| `apt:geographicalObject` | geographical name object | A reference to a geographical object | This replaces several ISO19160-1 & GNAF values as this reference can be used to any category of Geographical Object with the name for the object used within the address this part is part of. Geographical Object categories are assigned to the Geographical Object, not any part of this address part or the address it is part of.
| `apt:subaddressType` | sub-address type | The type of the sub-address part | Replaces GNAF's flatTypeCode
| `apt:subaddressNumber` | sub-address number | The number of the sub-address part | Replaces GNAF's flatNumber
| `apt:subaddressNumberPrefix` | sub-address number prefix |  | Replaces GNAF's flatNumberPrefix
| `apt:subaddressNumberSuffix` | sub-address number suffix |  | Replaces GNAF's flatNumberSuffix
| ... | ... | ... | ...
| `apt:locality` | locality | A reference to a Locality object | Replaces ISO19160-1's localityName
| `apt:waterFeature` | water feature | A reference to a Water Feature object | New in this model
| ... | ... | ... | ...

==== Address Lifecycle Stage Types

This vocabulary is currently as per <<ISO19160-1>>'s `AddressLifecycleStage` vocabulary, however it is expected that this vocabulary will be extended early in its use in Australia/NZ as it is know that jurisdictions within ANZ use other statuses

The Persistent web identifier for this vocabulary is:

| IRI | Preferred Label | Definition

| `als:current` | current | The address is recognised by the authoritative jurisdiction and is in use
| `als:reserved` | reserved | The address is recognised by the authoritative jurisdiction but is not yet in use
| `als:retired` | retired | The address was recognised by the authoritative jurisdiction but is no longer in use
| `als:proposed` | proposed | The address has been suggested for use but not yet accepted
| `als:rejected` | rejected | The address has been ruled not for use
| `als:unknown` | unknown | The stage of this Address' life is unknown therefore it is assumes as a form of unofficial

==== Geocode Type

This vocabulary was derived from the geocode types given as reference values in the <<GNAF>>.

This is only a partial rendering of the vocabulary - a static list of the top concepts as they were in June, 2023 - provided to give an indicate of values, not to be an exhaustive list of values.
